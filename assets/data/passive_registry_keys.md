# CREDD — PASSIVE REGISTRY KEY LIST (authoritative)

Every key below MUST have a function in `/engine/passiveRegistry.js`, implemented per its
effect text under Master §35.1 (one round clock; CC + stat-debuffs = 1 turn; Bleed/Burn
DOTs = 2 ticks; first-hit = first-action flag; stacks per turn; bonus hits are riders).
`none` is the shared no-op. Generated from the three seed files — regenerate if seeds change.
